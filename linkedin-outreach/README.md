# 🤖 LinkedIn Outreach Automation

Because manually copy-pasting "Let's connect!" 500 times isn't anyone's idea of fun.

## What is this?

A totally-not-robotic way to automate your LinkedIn outreach while keeping it personal and authentic. Think of it as your friendly neighborhood networking assistant (minus the spider powers).

## Features

- 📝 Customizable message templates
- 🎯 Smart targeting options
- ⏰ Rate limiting to keep LinkedIn happy
- 🔒 Safe and ToS-compliant
- 🎭 Human-like behavior patterns

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo (the usual git magic)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your settings in `.env`
4. Run: `npm start`
5. Watch the connections roll in while you drink coffee ☕

## Important Notes

- 🚫 Don't spam - nobody likes that
- 🎨 Customize your messages - templates are just starting points
- 🐢 Start slow - Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither should your network
